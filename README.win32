Building on windows is a bit different but not harder.

Just run the following command in an msys shell:
(cd preprocessed_src && ocamlbuild -Is makeypkg,yypkg,args,sherpa -libs unix,bigarray,nums,str,sexplib,fileutils {yypkg,makeypkg,sherpa,sherpa_gen}.native)

Finally, put them somewhere in your path and replace the ".native" suffix with ".exe".
